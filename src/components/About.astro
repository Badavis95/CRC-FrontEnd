          The Builder's Journey
        </h3>

        <p class="text-[var(--color-text-secondary)] text-lg leading-relaxed">
          I've been building things my whole life. The medium changes - the drive doesn't.
        </p>

        <p class="text-[var(--color-text-secondary)] leading-relaxed">
          At 20, I quit everything to launch an energy shot company. Not a side hustle - I went all in.
          Formulated the product myself (caffeine + L-theanine for calm focus), built the brand from scratch,
          sold thousands of bottles personally, appeared on local TV twice. I made it to VitaminShoppe
          national buyer meetings - distribution was within reach.
        </p>

        <p class="text-[var(--color-text-secondary)] leading-relaxed">
          Reality: CPG is expensive. No funding, no safety net. I worked retail jobs to survive while
          building Serenergy - not as a backup plan, but because I had to eat while chasing the dream.
          Never gave up. Then my commercial kitchen (Pilotworks Brooklyn) shut down in 2019, taking
          hundreds of food startups with it. Lost the means to make the product overnight.
        </p>

        <p class="text-[var(--color-text-secondary)] leading-relaxed">
          I pivoted to IT. Self-taught everything - no bootcamp, no CS degree. Convinced VitaminShoppe
          to promote me from retail Keyholder to IT Service Desk. That's trust earned, not a random job hop.
          Earned my AWS Solutions Architect certification. Now a System Administrator at TransCore.
        </p>

        <p class="text-[var(--color-text-secondary)] leading-relaxed">
          In August 2022 - three months before ChatGPT launched publicly - I had API access and was
          already building. Top 0.1% of early users (ChatGPT Wrapped verified). I've used every major
          provider extensively: OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude), Google, DeepSeek, Kimi. I've spent more on
          Claude than any other AI service because it's genuinely the most useful. Invested in an RTX 5090
          specifically for local model fine-tuning. I don't just use AI tools - I build AI systems.
        </p>

        <p class="text-[var(--color-text-secondary)] leading-relaxed">
          I have chronic pain from shoulder surgeries - every keystroke costs something. That's why I build
          voice-first interfaces. AI isn't abstract to me; it's how I get through my day.
